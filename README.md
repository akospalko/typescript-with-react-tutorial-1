# Learn Typescript with React
What it is:
* It is a little webapp where you can add a new wrist watch to an already existing collection. The ability to store watches in local storage and server database is yet to be implemented.  

What I learned about in this mini project: 
* Handling state and props with the help of interface implementation.
* How to handle functions and events 
* About some React specific types.

# Resources:
* This mini project is based on [Laith Academy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKcJxF0lAU&list=LL&index=2) React with TypeScript crash course.
